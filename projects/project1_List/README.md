### Project 1 : Homegrown Lists
##### Due Tuesday, October 27 before lab
##### Submit a single zipped file to Moodle

<hr>

#### Learning Outcomes:

- Be able to implement a generic type _List_ using an array.
- Be able to implement a generic type _List_ using a linked list.
- Be able to design and use tests to verify code.

<hr>

> You must earn a grade above the threshold of 60% on this project to pass this course. If after submission, you have not reached that threshold, you will have ample opportunity to work on the project until it meets this requirement. However, the grade will remain as it was for the work originally submitted.

#### General Requirements:

1. Write the class _ListLinked_ that implements the _List_ interface.
2. Extend functionality of _ListArray_ to match _ListLinked_.
2. Document all code using Javadocs.
1. Verify code using tests from Lab 4.

<hr>

### Getting Started

Start by creating a new project with all of your code from Lab 4. Add the _ListLinked.java_ file to the project. The file _List.java_ ensures that your List has all required methods.

### Primary Directive

You have essentially already completed half of this project. The other half is to repeat what you did, except use linked lists instead of arrays. And there are a few new methods to implement in both array and linked list.

Word of Advice: Code a little, then test. Code a little more, then test. Use the restructured tests from Lab 4 for the linked list implementation.

#### Assessment:

Complete the following to earn up to a C
- 15% : complete, compiles, and executes without throwing exception
- 10% : javadocs
- 65% : ListLinked passing all tests
- 10% : ListArray passing all tests
