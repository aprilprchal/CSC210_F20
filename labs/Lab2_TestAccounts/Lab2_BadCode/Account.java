This base class can be used as either a Debit or Credit account, depending on which interface is used. This is abstract and it is not meant to be implemented. Create other classes (e.g. Checking, Savings, Credit Card, Money Martket, etc.) as extensions of this with the appropriate interface.

 Note that a debit account has a positive balance, which indicates what the user has. In contrast, a positive balance for a credit account indicates something that the user owes the bank (which is really a negative balance from the user's perspective).
