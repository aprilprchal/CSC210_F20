### Lab 6 : Iteration, Recursion, and Binary Search
##### Due Monday, Nov 2 (no lab Tuesday -- Happy Voting Day!!)
##### Submit a single zipped file to Moodle

##### DUE TODAY, October 27 in-lab exercises. Submit via Moodle.

<hr>

#### General Requirements:

1. In-lab exercises sumUpTo() and sum().
2. add() method in OrderedList.
3. find (non-recursive) method in OrderedList using binary search.
4. findRecursive method in OrderedList using binary search.
5. In-class exercise Person class.

<hr>

### Your Assignment

Start with the _TestRecursion.java_ file. In lab today, complete the 2 in-lab exercises sumUpTo() and sum().

> Submit the file TestRecursion.java (no zip please!!).

On to an ordered list ... This is in coordination with your in-class exercise of creating an ordered list of people. The ordered list can be completed and tested independent of the Person class. The methods to complete are:
- add : maintain the order of the list using compareTo.
- find : use binary search to find the given element.
- findRecursive : use a recursive version of bineary search to find the given element.
Use the TestNumbers.java file to test your add, find, and findRecursive methods.

> Note that you will not receive any credit for using a linear search in your find or an add that simply adds to the end of the array.

Once you have completed the Person class (which you will have time to work on with your partner during class on Wednesday -- possibly Friday), you can incorporate that into this lab and use TestPersons.java to confirm everything is working.

### Assessment

10% : compiles^ and executes
15% : in-lab sumUptTo and sum exercises
25% : find using binary search (not linear!)
25% : findRecursive using binary search (not iterative, not linear!)
05% : add method that maintains order using compareTo
10% : class Person complete and correct (tested with TestPerson.java)
10% : javadocs

^ Compilation means that the TestRecursion.java and TestNumbers.java files compile without me having to modify anything. As stated in class, submitting a lab or a project that does not compile will result in an automatic 10% reduction. You will have to fix it so that I can grade it.
